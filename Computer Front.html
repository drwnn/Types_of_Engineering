    <h1><p style="color: black ; font-family: monospace;">Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers not only require training in electronic engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, yet it also demands them to integrate into the larger picture.[2] Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color: black ; font-family: monospace;">Computer engineering refers to the development of hardware and software needed for functional computers. If you have analysis and problem-solving skills and an interest in programming or coding, you may get a degree in computer engineering. By pursuing a career in computer engineering, you learn critical technology, analytical and communication skills you can transfer to other technology-based occupations.</p><h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as circuit boards. Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers.</p></h1>    
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Increasingly, computer engineers are involved in the design of computer-based systems to address highly specialized and specific application needs. Computer engineers work in most industries, including the computer, aerospace, telecommunications, power production, manufacturing, defense, and electronics industries. They design high-tech devices ranging from tiny microelectronic integrated-circuit chips, to powerful systems that utilize those chips and efficient telecommunication systems that interconnect those systems. Applications include consumer electronics (CD and DVD players, televisions, stereos, microwaves, gaming devices) and advanced microprocessors, peripheral equipment, systems for portable, desktop and client/server computing, and communications devices (cellular phones, pagers, personal digital assistants). It also includes distributed computing environments (local and wide area networks, wireless networks, internets, intranets), and embedded computer systems (such as aircraft, spacecraft, and automobile control systems in which computers are embedded to perform various functions). A wide array of complex technological systems, such as power generation and distribution systems and modern processing and manufacturing plants, rely on computer systems developed and designed by computer engineers.</p></h1>
