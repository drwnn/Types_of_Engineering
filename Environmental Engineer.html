    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Environmental engineers use the principles of engineering, soil science, biology, and chemistry to develop solutions to environmental problems. They work to improve recycling, waste disposal, public health, and water and air pollution control.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">The goal of environmental engineering is to ensure that societal development and the use of water, land and air resources are sustainable. This goal is achieved by managing these resources so that environmental pollution and degradation is minimized.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Examples of environmental engineering projects include dams, systems for recycling and reusing building waste in construction, municipal water supply and wastewater treatment facilities, plants to desalinate ocean water to irrigate crops, systems that assist refineries in reducing air pollutants, and more.</p></h1>
