    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">What is Chemical Engineering?
        <br>
        Chemical engineering involves the production and manufacturing of products through chemical processes. This includes designing equipment, systems, and processes for refining raw materials and for mixing, compounding, and processing chemicals.</p><h1>
            <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Chemical engineers translate processes developed in the lab into practical applications for the commercial production of products, and then work to maintain and improve those processes. They rely on the main foundations of engineering: math, physics, and chemistry. Biology also plays an increasingly important role.</p><h1>
                <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Chemical engineers develop and design chemical manufacturing processes. Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products.</p></h1>
                <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food and many other products, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). </p></h1>
                <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Graduates of Chemical Engineering may pursue a career path in various development and agricultural companies or government agencies that needs specialized Chemical Engineering services. They may apply for roles such as a chemical engineer, manufacturing engineer, plant process engineer, and quality control engineer, process safety engineer, or even a chemical engineering professor.</p></h1>
