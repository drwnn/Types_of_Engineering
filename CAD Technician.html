    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">CAD technician, also known as a draughtsperson, uses CAD software to create technical drawings and plans - also known as draughting - for products and parts used in the engineering, construction and manufacturing industries.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">You'll work with architects and design engineers to understand the requirements of their initial designs and turn them into accurate and detailed technical drawings in 2D and 3D models. These drawings are used at all stages of a project, from estimating cost and feasibility to creating the blueprints for manufacturing and instructions for installation.</p><h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">A CAD career as a drafter typically requires working full-time in an office. You might be required to go onsite for a specific job, but most of your time is spent at a computer producing designs, adjusting designs, responding to feedback, and working with engineers and architects.</p></h1>
