    <h1><p style="color:black; font-family:  monospace;">What Is Mechanical Engineering?
        <br>
        <br>        Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.
        </p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.</p><h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">
            This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.</p><h1>
            <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">Being ingrained in many challenges and innovations across many fields means a mechanical engineering education is versatile. To meet this broad demand, mechanical engineers may design a component, a machine, a system, or a process. This ranges from the macro to the micro, from the largest systems like cars and satellites to the smallest components like sensors and switches. Anything that needs to be manufactured—indeed, anything with moving parts—needs the expertise of a mechanical engineer.</p><h1>
                <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Mechanical engineering combines creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality.</p></h1> 
                <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Mechanical engineers have an enormous range of opportunity and their education mirrors this breadth of subjects. Students concentrate on one area while strengthening analytical and problem-solving skills applicable to any engineering situation.</p></h1>
