    <h1><center><p style="color:white ; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Engineering is the application of Science and Maths to solve problems. While scientist and inventors come up with innovation, it is engineers who apply these discoveries to the real world.</p></center></h1>
    <h1><center><p style="color:white ; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Engineering is part of STEM education, which aims to engage students with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics yet, as a discipline, it has been practiced for thousands of years.</p></center><h1>
        <h1><center><p style="color:white ; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">You can see examples of engineering in the Pyramids of Giza, at Stonehenge, the Parthenon and elsewhere. Yet, today's engineers operate in many different areas as well as building structures.</p></center><h1>
            <h1><center><p style="color: white ; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Engineers work on everything from cell membranes to construction and prosthetics to improving engine and transport efficiencies and developing renewable energy resources.</p></center><h1>
                <h1><center><p style="color:white ; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">While engineering dates right back to the invention of the wheel (and beyond), the term itself comes from the word engineer, which goes back to the 14th century, when an 'engine'er' meant someone who constructed military engines like catapults and other 'siege engines.' This military meaning can still be seen in use today with the Corps of Royal Engineers and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers.</p></center></h1>
