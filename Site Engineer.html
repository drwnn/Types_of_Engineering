    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">Site Engineers are responsible for planning, marking out and levelling construction sites before any building works takes place. They also build roads, drainage systems and other vital facilities to make sure construction projects go off without a hitch.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Site engineers typically come from several engineering disciplines, including civil, structural, electrical, or mechanical backgrounds. They can also work on a variety of construction and infrastructure projects, alongside the rest of a site management team.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">The main difference between site managers and site engineers is that site engineers tend to have a more specific, technical knowledge and expertise. Site engineers typically come from a civil, structural, geotechnical, building services, mechanical or electrical engineering background and manage packages related to those areas.</p></h1>
