    <h1><p style="color:white ; font-family: monospace;">Industrial engineering is an engineering profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information and equipment. Industrial engineering is central to manufacturing operations.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:white ; font-family: monospace;">Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical and social sciences, together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems and processes.[2] There are several industrial engineering principles followed in the manufacturing industry to ensure the effective flow of the systems, processes and operations.[3] This includes Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, Information Systems, Process Capability and Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control (DMAIC). These principles allow the creation of new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of labor, materials and machines and also improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social.[4][5] Depending on the subspecialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, operations research, systems engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, supply chain engineering, management science, management engineering, financial engineering, ergonomics or human factors engineering, safety engineering, logistics engineering or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.</p><h1>
        <h1><p style="color:white ; font-family: monospace;">Before you apply for industrial engineering jobs, it's important to consider your career options. Industrial engineering careers span several specialty areas. By researching different careers to pursue in industrial engineering, you can determine which jobs interest you the most and which to focus on in your job search.</p><h1>
