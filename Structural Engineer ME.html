    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Structural Engineer designs, plan and oversee the construction of new buildings and bridges, or alterations and extensions to existing properties or other structures. It can be very satisfying to have the chance to see something you've had a part in become a reality.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Structural engineering is a branch of civil engineering that is concerned with the structural design of man-made structures. Often described as designing the ‘bones and muscles’ of structures, these engineers need to understand the rigidity, stability and strength of both buildings and non-building structures. This includes factors such as loading and susceptibility to earthquakes.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Structural engineers work with architects, building services engineers and other professionals and may be charged with supervising construction projects. In addition, structural engineers can also be involved in the design of other assets where structural integrity impacts function and safety, such as machinery, medical equipment and vehicles.</p></h1>
