    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">Pursuing a degree in electrical engineering can lead to a variety of exciting career paths. However, job options and opportunities depend on the degree you earn, so it is important to understand what degree and career options are available and what qualifications they require. In this article, we will discuss electrical engineering degrees, how to earn them and what careers they make available to you.</p><h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems, or power generation equipment. Electrical engineers also design the electrical systems of automobiles and aircraft.</p></h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering, and dates back to the late 19th century. It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity. Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators.</p></h1>
        <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">"Electrical engineers design, develop, test and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems and power generation equipment, states the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Electronics engineers design and develop electronic equipment, such as broadcast and communications systems â€” from portable music players to global positioning systems (GPS)."</p></h1>
