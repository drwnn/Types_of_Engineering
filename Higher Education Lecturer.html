    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace">Lecturers plan and deliver teaching on their specialist subject to university students. This includes creating teaching materials, preparing for tutorials/seminars and marking studentsâ€™ work, as well as direct teaching. They also research their subject, attending conferences and writing articles, books and other materials to share their knowledge. They are supported by higher education administrators and work with other university staff such as librarians to make sure students have access to the resources they need to do well.</p></h1>
