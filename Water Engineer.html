    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace;">As a Water Engineer, your main concern will be the provision of clean water, but you may work with a variety of other liquid as well. Asset Management will also play a major part in your work, and you'll be involved in the repair, maintenance and building of structures that control water resources. Examples include sea defence walls, pumping stations and reservoirs.</p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace"> You may become involved in broader water-related issues, such as global warming, ageing infrastracture, population growth and quality of living standards. </p></h1>
    <h1><p style="color:black ; font-family: monospace"> Water Engineer is a generic title given to engineers who specialise in water-based projects. Many have a civil engineering or environmental background.</p><h1>
